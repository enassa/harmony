    "body":"Open and equal access to information is in high demand, yet may be impeded by social, cultural and economic barriers. The question of access at the same time encourages discussions on the technical, legal, and practical modes of accessibility. These concerns amongst other related issues were addressed under the theme: Access and Accessibility - Archival Policies and Barriers in the Age of Global Information Exchange, at this year’s International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives (IASA) 49th Annual Conference.  The conference was hosted by the Institute of African Studies at the University of Ghana from Monday, October 1 to Thursday, October 4, 2018. Papers and tutorials at this year’s annual conference in Ghana focused on the prospects and limitations of global and local access and accessibility to audiovisual archives as well as on issues of discovery, care, preservation, and dissemination of our sound and audiovisual heritage.",
